##User Engagement with a Social Discovery App

This project is based on confidential data. Consequently, only the content of my code folder are shared here.

###Motivation
This project was motivated by a business question. The owners of the app wanted to know how many users were churning and who those users are.


###EDA

The project started with exploratory data analysis of various features of the user dataset. In looking at overall user churn, it was clear that there are more users who have not churned than there are users who have churned.
